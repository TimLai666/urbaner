name: human-writing
description: Use when writing, rewriting, polishing, editing, drafting, humanizing, or improving any text meant to be read by people. This is the default skill for human-facing writing such as emails, docs, memos, proposals, landing-page copy, social posts, essays, commentary, explanatory prose, product copy, internal updates, and other reader-facing text that should feel natural, believable, and human-readable in Chinese or English.

# Human Writing

## Overview

Treat this as the default prose skill for anything a person will read.
Use it for both `rewrite` and `generate` tasks. Aim for writing that sounds like someone meant it, not like a model averaged it.

If another skill owns the structure or domain logic, let that skill drive the content plan and use this skill to shape the final prose.

## Workflow

1. Detect `mode`.
   - Use `rewrite` when source text exists.
   - Use `generate` when the user wants new text from notes, bullets, or intent.
2. Detect `audience_and_context`.
   - Identify who will read it and what the text must do.
   - Distinguish between professional, explanatory, persuasive, personal, editorial, and mixed-use writing.
3. Detect `language_behavior`.
   - Match the user's language by default.
   - Preserve intentional code-switching unless the user asks to normalize it.
4. Select `style_mode`.
   - Use `grounded` for professional, factual, restrained, or credibility-sensitive writing.
   - Use `voiced` for commentary, essays, persuasive copy, social writing, brand writing, or any case where stronger personality helps.
5. Draft or rewrite.
   - Make the prose specific rather than vague.
   - Make it controlled rather than inflated.
   - Make it varied rather than templated.
   - Make it voiced when useful and restrained when needed.
6. Run a cleanup pass.
   - Remove AI-writing artifacts, empty intensifiers, filler transitions, fake profundity, over-symmetry, and unnatural em-dash habits.
   - Keep the meaning, facts, and intent intact.

## Mode guide

### Rewrite

Use when the user provides source text and wants it to read better.

1. Preserve the original claim, purpose, and factual boundaries.
2. Keep useful structure unless the structure itself causes stiffness.
3. Remove obvious AI tells first, then fix rhythm and voice.
4. Improve precision before adding flair.
5. If the source is already strong, edit lightly.

### Generate

Use when the user wants fresh prose from an idea, outline, notes, or a vague request.

1. Infer the implied audience and intent from the prompt.
2. Choose the narrowest effective format instead of over-explaining.
3. Write as if a competent person with a point of view sat down to say it.
4. Do not pad thin inputs with generic significance language.
5. When details are missing, stay concrete but avoid invented facts.

## Style modes

### Grounded

Use for business writing, internal updates, memos, documentation, proposals, factual summaries, and other trust-sensitive text.

- Prefer direct claims, plain syntax, and calm confidence.
- Use specific nouns and verbs over abstract framing.
- Keep tone natural without sounding casual for no reason.
- Let credibility come from clarity, not polish theater.

### Voiced

Use for commentary, opinion, social posts, persuasive copy, essays, and prose that benefits from character.

- Allow stronger rhythm shifts, sharper phrasing, and controlled opinion.
- Add personality through perspective, not gimmicks.
- Use texture sparingly: a quick aside, a clean turn, a pointed line.
- Keep it human, not performatively quirky.

## Quality bar

Before finalizing, check that the text:

- says something concrete
- sounds like it was written for someone, not for a benchmark
- does not rely on vague authorities or inflated importance
- does not march in identical sentence lengths
- does not lean on unnatural em dashes to simulate voice
- does not hide weak thinking behind smooth phrasing
- matches the user's language and implied social context
